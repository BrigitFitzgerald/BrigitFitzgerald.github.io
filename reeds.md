      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>I love making reeds, and I am happy to share them with you! My reeds have a modified Herzberg scrape, with the dimensions that are included in the diagram. Each reed is rigorously tested and sanitized before it is sold. I do all of my work by hand, in order to ensure the best reed from each unique piece of cane. If you would like to request a specialty reed (ex: 2nd bassoon, high note, higher pitch) please contact me with your request.</p>
