    <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>I love making reeds, and I am happy to share them with you! My reeds have a modified Herzberg scrape, with the dimensions that are included in the diagram. Each reed 
        is rigorously tested and sanitized before it is sold. I do all of my work by hand, in order to ensure the best reed from each unique piece of cane. If you would like 
        to request a specialty reed (ex: 2nd bassoon, high note, higher pitch), please contact me with your request.</p>
    <h1>Pricing</h1>
      <p>• $15 per reed</p>
      <p>• $10 for shipping and handling</p>
      <p>• A free reed is included with each order!</p>
